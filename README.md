# C-Bits-And-Bytes

Welcome to my C programming repository! ðŸ’»  
Here I solve common coding problems and build DSA solutions using C.

## ðŸ“Œ What you'll find here:
- Classic DSA questions in C
- Coding practice problems
- Recursion and memory-level challenges
- Neat, understandable code with comments

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Overview
- `arrays/` â€“ Array-based problems
- `strings/` â€“ String manipulation problems
- `recursion/` â€“ Recursive problems and logic
- `sorting/` â€“ Classic sorting algorithms
- `linked_list/` â€“ Linked list implementations
- `stack/`, `queue/` â€“ Stack & queue data structures
- `trees/`, `graphs/` â€“ Binary trees and graphs

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
